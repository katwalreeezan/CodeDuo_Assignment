# Project Setup

1. **Download or Clone the Code**
   - Download the code from GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Open the Code**
   - Navigate to the downloaded/cloned project directory in your terminal.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to install project dependencies:
    "npm install" 

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Inside the `.env` file, add the following line:
     VITE_API_URL=YOUR_API_URL_HERE
   Replace `YOUR_API_URL_HERE` with the actual URL of the API.

5. **Run the Development Server**
   - Once you've set up the environment variables, you can start the development server by running:
     "npm run dev"
   This command will compile the code and start a development server. You should be able to access your application at the specified local URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

6. **Accessing the Application**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL where your application is running (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).

7. **Start Developing!**
   - You're all set up! Now you can use developed application.
